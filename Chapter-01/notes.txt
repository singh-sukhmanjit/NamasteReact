Read about Emmet - Gives boilerplate code
What is CDN

Include react, react dom using cdn
<div id="root">Not rendered</div>
Anything inside root will not render as React will override it.
If React is not included or is not working then Not rendered will print on screen. Its also a industry standard practise	
const heading = React.createElement("h1", {}, "Hello World")
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"))

createRoot will tell in which element react will run

Difference b/w async and defer

Assignment
Build html file
Use js then react create root, createElement
install all extensions
